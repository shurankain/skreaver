# Skreaver

**Skreaver** is a Rust-native coordination runtime for building modular AI agents and agentic infrastructures.

Skreaver aims to be the *Tokio* of agent systems: lightweight, pluggable, and ready for real-world orchestration.

---

## 🧠 Why Skreaver?

Modern AI agents suffer from:

- Complex stacks (Python + LangChain + glue code)
- Implicit architectures and fragile wrappers
- Poor performance in constrained or embedded environments

**Skreaver** solves this with a strict, high-performance, type-safe platform built in Rust, designed for real-world agent deployment.

---

## ⚙️ Core Principles

- **Rust 2024-first**: zero-cost abstractions, full control
- **Agent-centric**: traits and modules for memory, tools, goals
- **Composable runtime**: run agents locally or integrate with infra
- **Open by design**: build your own memory/tool systems, no lock-in

Skreaver gives you the scaffolding. You build the logic.

📦 Status: Skreaver is in active development.

Core components implemented:
- `Agent`, `Memory`, and `Tool` traits
- Basic Coordinator runtime
- Self-hosted CI pipeline
- First working example: Echo Agent (`cargo run --example echo`)

Next steps:
- Tool execution integration
- Modular memory backends
- CLI scaffolding and docs
