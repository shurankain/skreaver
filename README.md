# Skreaver

**Skreaver** is a Rust-native coordination runtime for building modular AI agents and agentic infrastructures.

Skreaver aims to be the *Tokio* of agent systems: lightweight, pluggable, and ready for real-world orchestration.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- Rust-native agent architecture
- Decoupled `Agent` / `Memory` / `Tool` model
- Multi-tool execution with result aggregation
- Built-in tool registry system
- File-backed memory support via `FileMemory`
- **HTTP runtime with RESTful API endpoints**
- **Standard tool library (HTTP, File, JSON, Text processing)**
- **Production-grade benchmarking framework with CI integration**
- Designed for performance and modularity

---

## 🧠 Why Skreaver?

Modern AI agents suffer from:

- Complex stacks (Python + LangChain + glue code)
- Implicit architectures and fragile wrappers
- Poor performance in constrained or embedded environments

**Skreaver** solves this with a strict, high-performance, type-safe platform built in Rust, designed for real-world agent deployment.

---

## ⚙️ Core Principles

- **Rust 2024-first**: zero-cost abstractions, full control  
- **Agent-centric**: traits and modules for memory, tools, goals  
- **Composable runtime**: run agents locally or integrate with infra  
- **Open by design**: build your own memory/tool systems, no lock-in

📦 Status: Skreaver is in active development.

Core components implemented:

* `Agent`, `Memory`, and `Tool` traits
* Modular `Coordinator` runtime
* `ToolRegistry` with dispatch and test coverage
* Support for multiple tool calls per step
* `FileMemory` (persistent key-value storage)
* **Axum-based HTTP runtime with RESTful endpoints**
* **Standard tool library (HTTP client, file ops, JSON/XML, text processing)**
* **Production benchmarking framework with resource monitoring and CI integration**
* Fully working examples (`echo`, `multi_tool`, `http_server`, `standard_tools`)
* Self-hosted CI pipeline

Next steps:

* Pluggable DB-backed memory modules (PostgreSQL, SQLite)
* Agent test harness and mock tools
* Authentication and rate limiting
* Playground & live examples
* Developer docs (powered by skreaver-docs-starter)

---

## 🖥️ `skreaver-cli`

A dedicated command-line interface for running agents directly from terminal.

Examples:

```bash
cargo run -p skreaver-cli -- --name echo
cargo run -p skreaver-cli -- --name multi
```

* Supports interactive agent execution
* Uses `FileMemory` for persistent state
* Includes tool dispatch (e.g., `uppercase`, `reverse`)
* Echo and MultiTool agents available out of the box

> Add your own agents in `skreaver-cli/src/agents/`, plug into the CLI via `match`, and extend.

## 🌐 HTTP Runtime

Skreaver now includes a production-ready HTTP server for remote agent interaction:

```bash
cargo run --example http_server
```

**Available endpoints:**
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /agents` - List all agents  
- `GET /agents/{id}/status` - Get agent status
- `POST /agents/{id}/observe` - Send observation to agent
- `DELETE /agents/{id}` - Remove agent

**Example requests:**
```bash
# List agents
curl http://localhost:3000/agents

# Send observation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/agents/demo-agent-1/observe \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"input": "uppercase:hello world"}'
```

The HTTP runtime supports all standard tools and provides full agent lifecycle management.

## ⚡ Performance Benchmarks

Skreaver includes a comprehensive performance benchmarking framework designed for production environments:

```bash
# Quick benchmarks (completes in ~30 seconds)
cargo bench --bench quick_benchmark

# Production benchmark with resource monitoring
cargo bench --bench production_benchmark

# Memory and CPU profiling benchmarks
cargo bench --bench memory_operations

# Realistic agent workload benchmarks
cargo bench --bench realistic_benchmarks
```

**Production Benchmark Framework Features:**
- **Resource Monitoring**: Real-time memory and CPU tracking during benchmarks
- **Performance Thresholds**: Automated pass/fail based on latency targets (p50<30ms, p95<200ms, p99<400ms)
- **Baseline Management**: Historical performance tracking with regression detection
- **Multi-format Reports**: JSON, Markdown, GitHub Actions, and JUnit XML outputs
- **CI Integration**: Automated performance gates in GitHub Actions workflow

**Performance Highlights:**
- Memory operations: ~350ns store, ~130ns load
- File I/O: ~17μs read (1KB), ~111μs write (1KB) 
- JSON processing: ~3.5μs simple, ~5.5μs complex
- **8-500x faster than Python agent frameworks** (see `PERFORMANCE_COMPARISON.md`)

▶️ Try it now:

```bash
# Local examples
cargo run --example echo
cargo run --example multi_tool
cargo run --example standard_tools

# HTTP server (RESTful agent runtime)
cargo run --example http_server
# Then test with: curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Performance benchmarks
cargo bench --bench quick_benchmark
cargo bench --bench production_benchmark
```
