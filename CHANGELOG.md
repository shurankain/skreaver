### Migration Guide

#### From Monolithic to Workspace Architecture

**Old Import Pattern:**
```rust
use skreaver::{Agent, Memory, Tool, Coordinator};
use skreaver::{InMemoryMemory, FileMemory};
use skreaver::{HttpTool, JsonTool};
```

**New Import Pattern:**
```rust
// For application development (recommended)
use skreaver::{Agent, Memory, Tool, Coordinator};
use skreaver::{InMemoryMemory, FileMemory, RedisMemory};
use skreaver::{HttpTool, JsonTool};

// For advanced usage (direct crate access)
use skreaver_core::{Agent, Memory, Tool, Coordinator, InMemoryMemory};
use skreaver_memory::{FileMemory, RedisMemory, NamespacedMemory};
use skreaver_tools::{HttpTool, JsonTool, FileReadTool};
use skreaver_http::{HttpRuntime, SecurityConfig};
```

#### Memory Backend Changes

**InMemoryMemory Location:**
- **Before**: `skreaver_memory::InMemoryMemory` 
- **After**: `skreaver_core::InMemoryMemory`

**Feature Flag Requirements:**
```toml
[dependencies]
skreaver = { version = "0.1", features = ["redis", "sqlite"] }
# Or for specific backends:
skreaver-memory = { version = "0.1", features = ["redis"] }
```

#### Tool System Breaking Changes

**Tool Dispatch:**
```rust
// Old API (removed)
coordinator.execute_tool_by_name("http_get", params).await?;

// New API (type-safe)
let tool = HttpTool::new(url);
coordinator.execute_tool(tool).await?;

// Or with StandardTool enum
let standard_tool = StandardTool::Http(HttpTool::new(url));
coordinator.dispatch(standard_tool).await?;
```

#### Redis API Updates

**Pipeline Execution:**
```rust
// Old API (deprecated)
pipe.execute(&mut conn);

// New API (required)
pipe.exec(&mut conn).unwrap();
```

#### Feature Flag Changes

**HTTP Features:**
```toml
# Basic HTTP runtime
skreaver-http = { version = "0.1", features = ["auth"] }

# Full HTTP with UI (development only)
skreaver-http = { version = "0.1", features = ["auth", "openapi", "openapi-ui"] }

# Production HTTP
skreaver-http = { version = "0.1", features = ["auth", "openapi", "compression"] }
```

**Tools Features:**
```toml
# All tools (old default)
skreaver-tools = { version = "0.1", features = ["io", "network", "data"] }

# Selective tools (new approach)
skreaver-tools = { version = "0.1", features = ["network"] }  # HTTP client only
skreaver-tools = { version = "0.1", features = ["data"] }     # JSON processing only
```

### Known Issues
- WebSocket support marked as `unstable-websocket` - API may change
- OpenAPI UI should only be enabled in development builds
- Redis connection pooling requires explicit configuration
- Large file operations may require increased timeout limits

### Compatibility
- **Minimum Rust Version**: 1.80.0
- **Edition**: 2024
- **Platform Support**: Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Architecture**: x86_64, ARM64

## Development Guidelines

### Versioning Strategy
- **Patch versions** (0.1.x): Bug fixes, performance improvements, documentation
- **Minor versions** (0.x.0): New features, non-breaking API additions
- **Major versions** (x.0.0): Breaking changes, architectural updates

### Breaking Change Policy
- All breaking changes are documented with migration guides
- Deprecation warnings provided at least one minor version before removal
- `unstable-*` prefixed features may break in minor releases
- Internal crate APIs (`skreaver-*::*`) may break without notice - use meta-crate `skreaver`

### Release Process
1. Update version numbers in all `Cargo.toml` files
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with release notes
3. Create git tag: `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0"`
4. Push tag: `git push origin v0.1.0`
5. GitHub Actions will automatically create release with binaries

### Contributing
- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format
- All changes must include appropriate tests
- Performance-sensitive changes require benchmark validation
- Security-related changes require threat model review
